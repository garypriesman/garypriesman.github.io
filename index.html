    <h2 class=coding>CODING!</h2>
    <h3>Types of Coding.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Programing</li>
      <li>Web design</li>
      <li>Data Design</li>
      <li>And More!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What kind am I doing?</h3>
      <p>I want to do <strong>Web Design</strong>. Web design is, "Design is the process of collecting ideas, and aesthetically arranging and implementing them, guided by certain principles for a specific purpose. Web design is a similar process of creation, with the intention of presenting the content on electronic web pages, which the end-users can access through the internet with the help of a web browser."(Jen Hawkyard)</p>
    <h3>Steps to take.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Learn html</li>
        <p>HTML stands for "HyperText-Markup-Language." HTML is what gives a website it's 'content' when you have just html you have a very plaing website, with little to no function or style.</p>
      <li>Learn CSS</li>
        <p>That is where CSS comes in! CSS stands for, "Cascading-Style-Sheets." It gives your website 'style/design.'  When you have you HTML typed in you can start a new CSS file and make your HTML file/website <strong class="pop">POP!</strong> You can see how the color has changed, this was due to the fact I used CSS code to make it <strong class="bold">BOLD</strong> and <strong class="pop">Pink!</strong></p>
      <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
        <p>Next is JavaScript. JavaScript is a bit more complicated to explain but to make it short JavaScript gives a website 'function.' It can allow websites to update live like <em>Facebook</em> or<em>Pinterest.</em> Or features of the like.</p>
